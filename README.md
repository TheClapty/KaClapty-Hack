# KaClapty!-Hack

This Kahoot hack is under development and bugs may appear. This hack is unblockable for your school and kahoot as it is no url linking it to the internet!

Steps:

1. Find the "KaClapty!.user.js" file.
2. Save the codefile if needed otherwise just go directly to step 3.
3. Open kahoot.it and execute the code in your console/cmd.
4. Then KaClapty should pop up on your kahoot.it tab.
5. After that find the "quizid" located on the hosts screen similar to this: "play.kahoot.it/v2/lobby?quizId=739c6780-b383..."
6. Now all you have todo is to paste/write the quizid into the quiz id section. Then you just connect to the kahoot as normal! Enjoy!


PS: If the section turns Green: You have entered the right quizid and you can continue! Red: The quizid is invalid or you have typed it wrong. It may also be a bug under development.
